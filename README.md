# How to Cross-Stitch
Cross-stitching is a type of needlework. It is a simple hand embroidery that is named for its X-shaped stitches. The stitched are done on Aida. Aida is a specific material that has small holes in the fabric. Many people begin the activity because it is easy to master.

## Required Materials
- Cross-stitch needle
- Aida fabric 
    > Note: There are different sizes of Aida. Size 14 is standard for beginners. Higher numbers will create a smaller pattern.

## Steps
1. Tape the edges of the Aida
2. Put the Aida in the hoop
    - Place the Aida fabric in between the top and bottom part of the embroidery hoop
    - Tighten the hoop by twisting the knob on the top of the hoop
    - Pull the Aida fabric tightly
3. Prepare the needle
    - Cut 12 inches of the embroidery thread
    - Separate 2 pieces of the thread
    - Insert the 2 pieces of thread into the needle
    - Create a small knot at the end of the thread
        > Note: There are 6 pieces of thread that make up the embroidery thread. Take 2 of the 6     pieces to use 
4. Insert the needle into a hole through the bottom of the fabric 
5. Pull the needle up and through
6. Re-Insert the needle into the hole diagonally to the right through the top
