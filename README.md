# How to Cross-Stitch
Cross-stitching is a type of needlework. It is a simple hand embroidery that is named for its X-shaped stitches. The stitched are done on Aida. Aida is a specific material that has small holes in the fabric. Many people begin the activity because it is easy to master.

## Required Materials
- Cross-stitch needle
- Aida fabric 
    > Note: There are different sizes of Aida. Size 14 is standard for beginners. Higher numbers will create a smaller pattern.

- Embroidery hoop
- Scissors
- Tape

## Steps
1. Tape the edges of the Aida
2. Put the Aida in the hoop
    - Place the Aida fabric in between the top and bottom part of the embroidery hoop
